## few words about the product


> ayooo, rscky. there! igu with a lot of new stuff that i want to talk 'bout. first of all want to describe the context while creating this all, sooo basically: safari is not only an album for me, cuz i feel it like a sequel to my previous album "deep" released on july 5, 2024. that project was full of unreleased demos that i did not wanted to release on my main alias "quei". i feel that "deep" was only an album with simple and sometimes (fr) real shitty songs from my bin, but after thinking a bit of it i decided to continue this era (btw i call it "era2") and create something unique. not only an music album but something that will have for me a story, feelings and 
emotions. and emotions are the very important in this cause it was my first inspiration. i needed a music for myself that will match exacly what i feel. due to this, my very first plans was to name this project "emotions". but why tf the name is "safari"? why not "emotions" (dk its better)? the answer is not that simple. its strongly connected with myself and for example as you can see on a "deep" cover art, there is a beautiful and deep desert. this photo was made on my trip on the sahara desert in 
tunisia, and at the same time i was working on "deep" project, so following up to this, i was in egypt while making "safari". the title is not cause of the apple's browser as a lot of you can think, but when i was on my trip in egypt, i went 2 times on safari and have an amaaaaazing memories with it. thats the reason why its called "safari". my favorite song from this all is i think "sleepin2" cause its a sec part of my song "sleepin" and 
i definetely loveee ittt!! from this point i want to give sooo much thanks to my friends that helped me with this all starting with flajuss. i really dont know how i can describe him, the best way is i think to just check out his music and then make ur own opinion. tbh i love this guy and love the way that we are working together on our projects 
(e.g. b4ckend). with that i decided to release my remix of his song "supernova" on this album. tysm broski!!! 
additionaly want to thank my brother ghaith from tunisia, whose voice can be heard in "sleepin2", my broski "ulixsz" and my lovely gf for all the support that you gave me in this few months and my bro "orzechuu" for your interest and collaborating in this project. unfortunately our collab didnt happen as with several other artists. this project really means a lot to me and i gave it my all to make this shitt outt, so please if you are reading this rn, open your ig and share this album with your friends. idk show it to your mom, dad, brother, sister - or just to anyone. i hope you will like all this stuff. in some track i even used my voice, soo check it out haha! product made and
